# Homebrew

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Homebrew/brew.svg)](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases)

Features, usage and installation instructions are [summarised on the homepage](https://brew.sh). Terminology (e.g. the difference between a Cellar, Tap, Cask and so forth) is [explained here](https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook#homebrew-terminology).

## What Packages Are Available?

1. Type `brew formulae` for a list.
2. Or visit [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh) to browse packages online.

## More Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Troubleshooting

First, please run `brew update` and `brew doctor`.

Second, read the [Troubleshooting Checklist](https://docs.brew.sh/Troubleshooting).

**If you don't read these it will take us far longer to help you with your problem.**

## Donations

Homebrew is a non-profit project run entirely by unpaid volunteers. We need your funds to pay for software, hardware and hosting around continuous integration and future improvements to the project. Every donation will be spent on making Homebrew better for our users.

Please consider a regular donation through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Homebrew), [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/homebrew) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/homebrew). Homebrew is fiscally hosted by the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource).

## Contributing

We'd love you to contribute to Homebrew. First, please read our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/.github/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

We explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once! We can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged. We are also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of colour.

A good starting point for contributing is to first [tap `homebrew/core`](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#can-i-edit-formulae-myself), then run `brew audit --strict` with some of the packages you use (e.g. `brew audit --strict wget` if you use `wget`) and read through the warnings. Try to fix them until `brew audit --strict` shows no results and [submit a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request). If no formulae you use have warnings you can run `brew audit --strict` without arguments to have it run on all packages and pick one.

Alternatively, for something more substantial, check out one of the issues labeled `help wanted` in [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Good luck!
