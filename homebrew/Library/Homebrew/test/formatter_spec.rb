      # Also, the text is designed in such a way such that options (e.g. `--foo`) would be wrapped to the
      # beginning of new lines if normal wrapping was used. This is to test that the method works as expected
      # and doesn't allow options to start new lines. Be careful when changing the text so these checks aren't lost.

        Usage: brew command [<options>] <formula>...

        This is a test command.
        Single line breaks are removed, but the entire line is still wrapped at the correct point.

        Paragraphs are preserved but
        are also wrapped at the right point. Here's some more filler text to get this line to be long enough.
        Options, for example: --foo, are never placed at the start of a line.

        `brew command` [`state`]:
        Display the current state of the command.

        `brew command` (`on`|`off`):
        Turn the command on or off respectively.

          -f, --foo                        This line is wrapped with a hanging indent. --test. The --test option isn't at the start of a line.
          -b, --bar                        The following option is not left on its own: --baz
          -h, --help                       Show this message.
