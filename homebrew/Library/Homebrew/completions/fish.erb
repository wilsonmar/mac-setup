# To make changes to the completions:
#
# - For changes to a command under `COMMANDS` or `DEVELOPER COMMANDS` sections):
#   - Find the source file in `Library/Homebrew/[dev-]cmd/<command>.{rb,sh}`.
#   - For `.rb` files, edit the `<command>_args` method.
#   - For `.sh` files, edit the top comment, being sure to use the line prefix
#     `#:` for the comments to be recognized as documentation. If in doubt,
#     compare with already documented commands.
# - For other changes: Edit this file.
#
# When done, regenerate the completions by running `brew generate-man-completions`.
%>
# Fish shell completions for Homebrew
# This file is automatically generated by running `brew generate-man-completions`.
# See Library/Homebrew/completions/fish.erb for editing instructions.

# A note about aliases:
#
# * When defining completions for the (sub)commands themselves, only the full names are used, as they
#   are more descriptive and worth completing. Aliases are usually shorter than the full names, and
#   exist exactly to save time for users who already know what they want and are going to type the
#   command anyway (i.e. without completion).
# * Nevertheless, it's important to support aliases in the completions for their arguments/options.
