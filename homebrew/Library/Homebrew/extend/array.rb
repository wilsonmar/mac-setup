class Array
  # Converts the array to a comma-separated sentence where the last element is
  # joined by the connector word.
  #
  # You can pass the following kwargs to change the default behavior:
  #
  # * <tt>:words_connector</tt> - The sign or word used to join all but the last
  #   element in arrays with three or more elements (default: ", ").
  # * <tt>:last_word_connector</tt> - The sign or word used to join the last element
  #   in arrays with three or more elements (default: ", and ").
  # * <tt>:two_words_connector</tt> - The sign or word used to join the elements
  #   in arrays with two elements (default: " and ").
