## Resolutions

### Motion to adopt the voting system

#### Project Leader

The Homebrew Project Leader will be chosen by holding a [Schulze Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method) election. This popular method of voting is used by several organizations such as Wikimedia, Debian and Ubuntu. The single highest-ranked candidate, who is preferred over every other candidate in pairwise comparisons, will be elected to become the Project Leader.

Voting by proxy is permitted, and proxy votes count towards the quorum for the election.

#### Project Leadership Committee (PLC)

The Homebrew Project Leadership Committee will be chosen by holding a [Meek Single Transferable Vote (STV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_single_transferable_votes#Meek) election. The quota (threshold) of votes for a candidate to be elected will be calculated using the [Droop quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droop_quota).

Voting by proxy is permitted, and proxy votes count towards the quorum for the election.
