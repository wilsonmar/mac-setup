brew(1) -- The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)
===========================================================

## SYNOPSIS

`brew` `--version`<br>
`brew` *`command`* [`--verbose`|`-v`] [*`options`*] [*`formula`*] ...

## DESCRIPTION

Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple
didn't include with macOS. It can also install software not packaged for your
Linux distribution without requiring `sudo`.

## TERMINOLOGY

**formula**: Homebrew package definition that builds from upstream sources

**cask**: Homebrew package definition that installs macOS native applications

**prefix**: path in which Homebrew is installed, e.g. `/usr/local`

**keg**: installation destination directory of a given **formula** version, e.g. `/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1`

**rack**: directory containing one or more versioned **kegs**, e.g. `/usr/local/Cellar/foo`

**keg-only**: a **formula** is *keg-only* if it is not symlinked into Homebrew's prefix

**opt prefix**: a symlink to the active version of a **keg**, e.g. `/usr/local/opt/foo`

**Cellar**: directory containing one or more named **racks**, e.g. `/usr/local/Cellar`

**Caskroom**: directory containing one or more named **casks**, e.g. `/usr/local/Caskroom`

**external command**: `brew` subcommand defined outside of the Homebrew/brew GitHub repository

**tap**: directory (and usually Git repository) of **formulae**, **casks** and/or **external commands**

**bottle**: pre-built **keg** poured into a **rack** of the **Cellar** instead of building from upstream sources

## ESSENTIAL COMMANDS

For the full command list, see the [COMMANDS](#commands) section.

With `--verbose` or `--debug`, many commands print extra debugging information.
Note that these options should only appear after a command.

Some command behaviour can be customised with environment variables; see the [ENVIRONMENT](#environment) section.

### `install` *`formula`*

Install *`formula`*.

*`formula`* is usually the name of the formula to install, but it has other
syntaxes which are listed in the [SPECIFYING FORMULAE](#specifying-formulae)
section.

### `uninstall` *`formula`*

Uninstall *`formula`*.

### `list`

List all installed formulae.

### `search` [*`text`*|`/`*`text`*`/`]

Perform a substring search of cask tokens and formula names for *`text`*. If
*`text`* is flanked by slashes, it is interpreted as a regular expression.
The search for *`text`* is extended online to `homebrew/core` and `homebrew/cask`.
If no search term is provided, all locally available formulae are listed.

## COMMANDS

### `analytics` [*`subcommand`*]

Control Homebrew's anonymous aggregate user behaviour analytics.
Read more at <https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics>.

`brew analytics` [`state`]
<br>Display the current state of Homebrew's analytics.

`brew analytics` (`on`|`off`)
<br>Turn Homebrew's analytics on or off respectively.

### `autoremove` [`--dry-run`]

Uninstall formulae that were only installed as a dependency of another formula and are now no longer needed.

* `-n`, `--dry-run`:
  List what would be uninstalled, but do not actually uninstall anything.

### `casks`

List all locally installable casks including short names.

### `cleanup` [*`options`*] [*`formula`*|*`cask`* ...]

Remove stale lock files and outdated downloads for all formulae and casks,
and remove old versions of installed formulae. If arguments are specified,
only do this for the given formulae and casks. Removes all downloads more than
120 days old. This can be adjusted with `HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`.

* `--prune`:
  Remove all cache files older than specified *`days`*. If you want to remove everything, use `--prune=all`.
* `-n`, `--dry-run`:
  Show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything.
* `-s`:
  Scrub the cache, including downloads for even the latest versions. Note that downloads for any installed formulae or casks will still not be deleted. If you want to delete those too: `rm -rf "$(brew --cache)"`
* `--prune-prefix`:
  Only prune the symlinks and directories from the prefix and remove no other files.

### `commands` [`--quiet`] [`--include-aliases`]

Show lists of built-in and external commands.

* `-q`, `--quiet`:
  List only the names of commands without category headers.
* `--include-aliases`:
  Include aliases of internal commands.

`brew completions` (`link`|`unlink`)
<br>Link or unlink Homebrew's completions.

### `config`, `--config`

Show Homebrew and system configuration info useful for debugging. If you file
a bug report, you will be required to provide this information.

### `deps` [*`options`*] [*`formula`*|*`cask`* ...]

Show dependencies for *`formula`*. When given multiple formula arguments,
show the intersection of dependencies for each formula. By default, `deps`
shows all required and recommended dependencies.

If any version of each formula argument is installed and no other options
are passed, this command displays their actual runtime dependencies (similar
to `brew linkage`), which may differ from the current versons' stated
dependencies if the installed versions are outdated.

*Note:* `--missing` and `--skip-recommended` have precedence over `--include-*`.

* `-n`, `--topological`:
  Sort dependencies in topological order.
* `-1`, `--direct`:
  Show only the direct dependencies declared in the formula.
* `--union`:
  Show the union of dependencies for multiple *`formula`*, instead of the intersection.

  Show only missing dependencies.
* `--eval-all`:
  Evaluate all available formulae and casks, whether installed or not, to list their dependencies.
* `--for-each`:
  Switch into the mode used by the `--all` option, but only list dependencies for each provided *`formula`*, one formula per line. This is used for debugging the `--installed`/`--all` display mode.
* `--formula`:
  Treat all named arguments as formulae.
* `--cask`:
  Treat all named arguments as casks.

### `desc` [*`options`*] *`formula`*|*`cask`*|*`text`*|`/`*`regex`*`/` [...]

Display *`formula`*'s name and one-line description.
The cache is created on the first search, making that search slower than subsequent ones.

### `shellenv [bash|csh|fish|pwsh|sh|tcsh|zsh]`

Print export statements. When run in a shell, this installation of Homebrew will be added to your `PATH`, `MANPATH`, and `INFOPATH`.

The variables `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`, `HOMEBREW_CELLAR` and `HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY` are also exported to avoid querying them multiple times.
To help guarantee idempotence, this command produces no output when Homebrew's `bin` and `sbin` directories are first and second
respectively in your `PATH`. Consider adding evaluation of this command's output to your dotfiles (e.g. `~/.profile`,
`~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zprofile`) with: `eval "$(brew shellenv)"`

The shell can be specified explicitly with a supported shell name parameter. Unknown shells will output POSIX exports.

### `tap` [*`options`*] [*`user`*`/`*`repo`*] [*`URL`*]

Tap a formula repository.
If no arguments are provided, list all installed taps.

With *`URL`* unspecified, tap a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS.
Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for
`brew tap` *`user`*`/`*`repo`* `https://github.com/`*`user`*`/homebrew-`*`repo`*.

With *`URL`* specified, tap a formula repository from anywhere, using
any transport protocol that `git`(1) handles. The one-argument form of `tap`
simplifies but also limits. This two-argument command makes no
assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and
using protocols other than HTTPS, e.g. SSH, git, HTTP, FTP(S), rsync.

* `--[no-]force-auto-update`:
  Auto-update tap even if it is not hosted on GitHub. By default, only taps hosted on GitHub are auto-updated (for performance reasons).

### `autoupdate` *`subcommand`* [*`interval`*] [*`options`*]

An easy, convenient way to automatically update Homebrew.

This script will run `brew update` in the background once every 24 hours (by default)
until explicitly told to stop, utilising `launchd`.

`brew autoupdate start` [*``interval``*] [*``options``*]
<br>Start autoupdating either once every `interval` hours or once every 24 hours.
Please note the interval has to be passed in seconds, so 12 hours would be
`brew autoupdate start 43200`. Pass `--upgrade` or `--cleanup` to automatically
run `brew upgrade` and/or `brew cleanup` respectively. Pass `--enable-notification`
to send a notification when the autoupdate process has finished successfully.

`brew autoupdate stop`
<br>Stop autoupdating, but retain plist and logs.

`brew autoupdate delete`
<br>Cancel the autoupdate, delete the plist and logs.

`brew autoupdate status`
<br>Prints the current status of this tool.

`brew autoupdate version`
<br>Output this tool's current version, and a short changelog.

* `--upgrade`:
  Automatically upgrade your installed formulae. If the Caskroom exists locally Casks will be upgraded as well. Must be passed with `start`.
* `--greedy`:
  Upgrade casks with --greedy (include auto-updating casks). Must be passed with `start`.
* `--cleanup`:
  Automatically clean brew's cache and logs. Must be passed with `start`.
* `--enable-notification`:
  Send a notification when the autoupdate process has finished successfully, if `terminal-notifier` is installed and found. Must be passed with `start`. Note: notifications are enabled by default on macOS Catalina and newer.
* `--immediate`:
  Starts the autoupdate command immediately, instead of waiting for one interval (24 hours by default) to pass first. Must be passed with `start`.

### `bundle` [*`subcommand`*]

Bundler for non-Ruby dependencies from Homebrew, Homebrew Cask, Mac App Store and Whalebrew.

`brew bundle` [`install`]
<br>Install and upgrade (by default) all dependencies from the `Brewfile`.

You can specify the `Brewfile` location using `--file` or by setting the `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_FILE` environment variable.

You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space-separated values to one or more of the following environment variables: `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_BREW_SKIP`, `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_CASK_SKIP`, `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_MAS_SKIP`, `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_WHALEBREW_SKIP`, `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_TAP_SKIP`.

`brew bundle` will output a `Brewfile.lock.json` in the same directory as the `Brewfile` if all dependencies are installed successfully. This contains dependency and system status information which can be useful in debugging `brew bundle` failures and replicating a "last known good build" state. You can opt-out of this behaviour by setting the `HOMEBREW_BUNDLE_NO_LOCK` environment variable or passing the `--no-lock` option. You may wish to check this file into the same version control system as your `Brewfile` (or ensure your version control system ignores it if you'd prefer to rely on debugging information from a local machine).

`brew bundle dump`
<br>Write all installed casks/formulae/images/taps into a `Brewfile` in the current directory.

`brew bundle cleanup`
<br>Uninstall all dependencies not listed from the `Brewfile`.

This workflow is useful for maintainers or testers who regularly install lots of formulae.

`brew bundle check`
<br>Check if all dependencies are installed from the `Brewfile`.

This provides a successful exit code if everything is up-to-date, making it useful for scripting.

`brew bundle list`
<br>List all dependencies present in the `Brewfile`.

By default, only Homebrew dependencies are listed.

`brew bundle exec` *`command`*
<br>Run an external command in an isolated build environment based on the `Brewfile` dependencies.

This sanitized build environment ignores unrequested dependencies, which makes sure that things you didn't specify in your `Brewfile` won't get picked up by commands like `bundle install`, `npm install`, etc. It will also add compiler flags which will help find keg-only dependencies like `openssl`, `icu4c`, etc.

* `--file`:
  Read the `Brewfile` from this location. Use `--file=-` to pipe to stdin/stdout.
* `--global`:
  Read the `Brewfile` from `~/.Brewfile`.
* `-v`, `--verbose`:
  `install` prints output from commands as they are run. `check` lists all missing dependencies.
* `--no-upgrade`:
  `install` won't run `brew upgrade` on outdated dependencies. Note they may still be upgraded by `brew install` if needed.
* `-f`, `--force`:
  `dump` overwrites an existing `Brewfile`. `cleanup` actually performs its cleanup operations.
* `--cleanup`:
  `install` performs cleanup operation, same as running `cleanup --force`.
* `--no-lock`:
  `install` won't output a `Brewfile.lock.json`.
* `--all`:
  `list` all dependencies.
* `--formula`:
  `list` Homebrew dependencies.
* `--cask`:
  `list` Homebrew Cask dependencies.
* `--tap`:
  `list` tap dependencies.
* `--mas`:
  `list` Mac App Store dependencies.
* `--whalebrew`:
  `list` Whalebrew dependencies.
* `--vscode`:
  `list` VSCode extensions.
* `--describe`:
  `dump` adds a description comment above each line, unless the dependency does not have a description.
* `--no-restart`:
  `dump` does not add `restart_service` to formula lines.
* `--zap`:
  `cleanup` casks using the `zap` command instead of `uninstall`.

  Only run the bottles fetch steps. This optional post-upload test checks that all the bottles were uploaded correctly. It is not run unless requested and only needs to be run on a single machine. The bottle commit to be tested must be on the tested branch.
* `--only-cleanup-after`:
  Only run the post-cleanup step. Needs `--cleanup`.
* `--testing-formulae`:
  Use these testing formulae rather than running the formulae detection steps.
* `--added-formulae`:
  Use these added formulae rather than running the formulae detection steps.
* `--deleted-formulae`:
  Use these deleted formulae rather than running the formulae detection steps.
* `--skipped-or-failed-formulae`:
  Use these skipped or failed formulae from formulae steps for a formulae dependents step.

### `unalias` *`alias`* [...]

Remove aliases.

### `which-formula` [`--explain`] *`command`* [...]

Prints the formula(e) which provides the given command.

* `--explain`:
  Output explanation of how to get 'cmd' by installing one of the providing formulae.

### `which-update` [*`options`*] [*`database`*]

Database update for `brew which-formula`

* `--stats`:
  Print statistics about the database contents (number of commands and formulae, list of missing formulae).
* `--commit`:
  Commit the changes using `git`.
* `--update-existing`:
  Update database entries with outdated formula versions.
* `--install-missing`:
  Install and update formulae that are missing from the database and don't have bottles.
* `--max-downloads`:
  Specify a maximum number of formulae to download and update.

## CUSTOM EXTERNAL COMMANDS

Homebrew, like `git`(1), supports external commands. These are executable
scripts that reside somewhere in the `PATH`, named `brew-`*`cmdname`* or
`brew-`*`cmdname`*`.rb`, which can be invoked like `brew` *`cmdname`*. This allows
you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew's internals.

Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs:
<https://docs.brew.sh/External-Commands>

## SPECIFYING FORMULAE

Many Homebrew commands accept one or more *`formula`* arguments. These arguments
can take several different forms:

  * The name of a formula:
    e.g. `git`, `node`, `wget`.

  * The fully-qualified name of a tapped formula:
    Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in
    `homebrew/core`.
    You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e.g.
    `homebrew/dupes/vim` or `homebrew/versions/node4`.

  * An arbitrary file:
    Homebrew can install formulae from a local path. It can point to either a
    formula file or a bottle.
    Prefix relative paths with `./` to prevent them from being interpreted as a
    formula or tap name.

## SPECIFYING CASKS

Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more *`cask`* arguments. These can be
specified the same way as the *`formula`* arguments described in
`SPECIFYING FORMULAE` above.

## ENVIRONMENT

Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected. For
example, run `export HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1` rather than just
`export HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT`.

`HOMEBREW_*` environment variables can also be set in Homebrew's environment
files:

* `/etc/homebrew/brew.env` (system-wide)

* `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/homebrew/brew.env` (prefix-specific)

* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/brew.env` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set or
  `$HOME/.homebrew/brew.env` otherwise (user-specific)

User-specific environment files take precedence over prefix-specific files and
prefix-specific files take precedence over system-wide files (unless
`HOMEBREW_SYSTEM_ENV_TAKES_PRIORITY` is set, see below).

- `HOMEBREW_API_DOMAIN`
  <br>Use this URL as the download mirror for Homebrew JSON API. If metadata files at that URL are temporarily unavailable, the default API domain will be used as a fallback mirror.

  *Default:* `https://formulae.brew.sh/api`.

- `HOMEBREW_ARCH`
  <br>Linux only: Pass this value to a type name representing the compiler's `-march` option.

  *Default:* `native`.

- `HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN`
  <br>Prefix all download URLs, including those for bottles, with this value. For example, `HOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080` will cause a formula with the URL `https://example.com/foo.tar.gz` to instead download from `http://localhost:8080/https://example.com/foo.tar.gz`. Bottle URLs however, have their domain replaced with this prefix. This results in e.g. `https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/gettext/manifests/0.21` to instead be downloaded from `http://localhost:8080/v2/homebrew/core/gettext/manifests/0.21`

- `HOMEBREW_API_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS`
  <br>Check Homebrew's API for new formulae or cask data every `HOMEBREW_API_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` seconds. Alternatively, disable API auto-update checks entirely with HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE.

  *Default:* `450`.

- `HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS`
  <br>Run `brew update` once every `HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` seconds before some commands, e.g. `brew install`, `brew upgrade` and `brew tap`. Alternatively, disable auto-update entirely with `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`.

  *Default:* 86400 (24 hours), 3600 (1 hour) if a developer command has been run or 300 (5 minutes) if `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API` is set.

- `HOMEBREW_AUTOREMOVE`
  <br>If set, calls to `brew cleanup` and `brew uninstall` will automatically remove unused formula dependents and if `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP` is not set, `brew cleanup` will start running `brew autoremove` periodically.

- `HOMEBREW_BAT`
  <br>If set, use `bat` for the `brew cat` command.

- `HOMEBREW_BAT_CONFIG_PATH`
  <br>Use this as the `bat` configuration file.

  *Default:* `$BAT_CONFIG_PATH`.

- `HOMEBREW_BAT_THEME`
  <br>Use this as the `bat` theme for syntax highlighting.

  *Default:* `$BAT_THEME`.

- `HOMEBREW_BOOTSNAP`
  <br>If set, use Bootsnap to speed up repeated `brew` calls. A no-op when using Homebrew's vendored, relocatable Ruby on macOS (as it doesn't work).

- `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN`
  <br>Use this URL as the download mirror for bottles. If bottles at that URL are temporarily unavailable, the default bottle domain will be used as a fallback mirror. For example, `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080` will cause all bottles to download from the prefix `http://localhost:8080/`. If bottles are not available at `HOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN` they will be downloaded from the default bottle domain.

  *Default:* `https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core`.

- `HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE`
  <br>Use this URL as the Homebrew/brew `git`(1) remote.

  *Default:* `https://github.com/Homebrew/brew`.

- `HOMEBREW_BROWSER`
  <br>Use this as the browser when opening project homepages.

  *Default:* `$BROWSER` or the OS's default browser.

- `HOMEBREW_CACHE`
  <br>Use this directory as the download cache.

  *Default:* macOS: `$HOME/Library/Caches/Homebrew`, Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Homebrew` or `$HOME/.cache/Homebrew`.

- `HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS`
  <br>Append these options to all `cask` commands. All `--*dir` options, `--language`, `--require-sha`, `--no-quarantine` and `--no-binaries` are supported. For example, you might add something like the following to your `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshenv`:

    `export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=~/Applications --fontdir=/Library/Fonts"`

- `HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS`
  <br>Cleanup all cached files older than this many days.

  *Default:* `120`.

- `HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_PERIODIC_FULL_DAYS`
  <br>If set, `brew install`, `brew upgrade` and `brew reinstall` will cleanup all formulae when this number of days has passed.

  *Default:* `30`.

- `HOMEBREW_COLOR`
  <br>If set, force colour output on non-TTY outputs.

- `HOMEBREW_CORE_GIT_REMOTE`
  <br>Use this URL as the Homebrew/homebrew-core `git`(1) remote.

  *Default:* `https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core`.

- `HOMEBREW_CURL_PATH`
  <br>Linux only: Set this value to a new enough `curl` executable for Homebrew to use.

  *Default:* `curl`.

- `HOMEBREW_CURL_RETRIES`
  <br>Pass the given retry count to `--retry` when invoking `curl`(1).

  *Default:* `3`.

- `HOMEBREW_CURL_VERBOSE`
  <br>If set, pass `--verbose` when invoking `curl`(1).

- `HOMEBREW_CURLRC`
  <br>If set to an absolute path (i.e. beginning with `/`), pass it with `--config` when invoking `curl`(1). If set but _not_ a valid path, do not pass `--disable`, which disables the use of `.curlrc`.

- `HOMEBREW_DEBUG`
  <br>If set, always assume `--debug` when running commands.

- `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER`
  <br>If set, tweak behaviour to be more relevant for Homebrew developers (active or budding) by e.g. turning warnings into errors.

- `HOMEBREW_DISABLE_LOAD_FORMULA`
  <br>If set, refuse to load formulae. This is useful when formulae are not trusted (such as in pull requests).

- `HOMEBREW_DISPLAY`
  <br>Use this X11 display when opening a page in a browser, for example with `brew home`. Primarily useful on Linux.

  *Default:* `$DISPLAY`.

- `HOMEBREW_DISPLAY_INSTALL_TIMES`
  <br>If set, print install times for each formula at the end of the run.

- `HOMEBREW_DOCKER_REGISTRY_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
  <br>Use this base64 encoded username and password for authenticating with a Docker registry proxying GitHub Packages. If `HOMEBREW_DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` is set, it will be used instead.

- `HOMEBREW_DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
  <br>Use this bearer token for authenticating with a Docker registry proxying GitHub Packages. Preferred over `HOMEBREW_DOCKER_REGISTRY_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.

- `HOMEBREW_EDITOR`
  <br>Use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same directory.

    *Note:* `brew edit` will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and directories. Visual Studio Code can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case.

  *Default:* `$EDITOR` or `$VISUAL`.

- `HOMEBREW_EVAL_ALL`
  <br>If set, `brew` commands evaluate all formulae and casks, executing their arbitrary code, by default without requiring --eval-all. Required to cache formula and cask descriptions.

- `HOMEBREW_FAIL_LOG_LINES`
  <br>Output this many lines of output on formula `system` failures.

  *Default:* `15`.

- `HOMEBREW_FORBIDDEN_LICENSES`
  <br>A space-separated list of licenses. Homebrew will refuse to install a formula if it or any of its dependencies has a license on this list.

- `HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CA_CERTIFICATES`
  <br>If set, always use a Homebrew-installed `ca-certificates` rather than the system version. Automatically set if the system version is too old.

- `HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_CURL`
  <br>If set, always use a Homebrew-installed `curl`(1) rather than the system version. Automatically set if the system version of `curl` is too old.

- `HOMEBREW_FORCE_BREWED_GIT`
  <br>If set, always use a Homebrew-installed `git`(1) rather than the system version. Automatically set if the system version of `git` is too old.

- `HOMEBREW_FORCE_VENDOR_RUBY`
  <br>If set, always use Homebrew's vendored, relocatable Ruby version even if the system version of Ruby is new enough.

- `HOMEBREW_GIT_EMAIL`
  <br>Set the Git author and committer email to this value.

- `HOMEBREW_GIT_NAME`
  <br>Set the Git author and committer name to this value.

- `HOMEBREW_GIT_PATH`
  <br>Linux only: Set this value to a new enough `git` executable for Homebrew to use.

  *Default:* `git`.

- `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`
  <br>Use this personal access token for the GitHub API, for features such as `brew search`. You can create one at <https://github.com/settings/tokens>. If set, GitHub will allow you a greater number of API requests. For more information, see: <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting>

    *Note:* Homebrew doesn't require permissions for any of the scopes, but some developer commands may require additional permissions.

- `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_PACKAGES_TOKEN`
  <br>Use this GitHub personal access token when accessing the GitHub Packages Registry (where bottles may be stored).

- `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_PACKAGES_USER`
  <br>Use this username when accessing the GitHub Packages Registry (where bottles may be stored).

- `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE`
  <br>Print this text before the installation summary of each successful build.

  *Default:* The "Beer Mug" emoji.

- `HOMEBREW_LIVECHECK_WATCHLIST`
  <br>Consult this file for the list of formulae to check by default when no formula argument is passed to `brew livecheck`.

  *Default:* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/livecheck_watchlist.txt` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set or `$HOME/.homebrew/livecheck_watchlist.txt` otherwise.

- `HOMEBREW_LOGS`
  <br>Use this directory to store log files.

  *Default:* macOS: `$HOME/Library/Logs/Homebrew`, Linux: `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/Homebrew/Logs` or `$HOME/.cache/Homebrew/Logs`.

- `HOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS`
  <br>Use this value as the number of parallel jobs to run when building with `make`(1).

  *Default:* The number of available CPU cores.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS`
  <br>If set, do not send analytics. Google Analytics were destroyed. For more information, see: <https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics>

- `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE`
  <br>If set, do not automatically update before running some commands, e.g. `brew install`, `brew upgrade` and `brew tap`. Alternatively, run this less often by setting `HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` to a value higher than the default.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_BOOTSNAP`
  <br>If set, do not use Bootsnap to speed up repeated `brew` calls.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_CLEANUP_FORMULAE`
  <br>A comma-separated list of formulae. Homebrew will refuse to clean up or autoremove a formula if it appears on this list.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_COLOR`
  <br>If set, do not print text with colour added.

  *Default:* `$NO_COLOR`.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_EMOJI`
  <br>If set, do not print `HOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE` on a successful build.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS`
  <br>If set, do not print any hints about changing Homebrew's behaviour with environment variables.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API`
  <br>If set, do not use the GitHub API, e.g. for searches or fetching relevant issues after a failed install.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT`
  <br>If set, forbid redirects from secure HTTPS to insecure HTTP.

    *Note:* while ensuring your downloads are fully secure, this is likely to cause from-source SourceForge, some GNU & GNOME-hosted formulae to fail to download.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP`
  <br>If set, `brew install`, `brew upgrade` and `brew reinstall` will never automatically cleanup installed/upgraded/reinstalled formulae or all formulae every `HOMEBREW_CLEANUP_PERIODIC_FULL_DAYS` days. Alternatively, `HOMEBREW_NO_CLEANUP_FORMULAE` allows specifying specific formulae to not clean up.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API`
  <br>If set, do not install formulae and casks in homebrew/core and homebrew/cask taps using Homebrew's API and instead use (large, slow) local checkouts of these repositories.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_UPGRADE`
  <br>If set, `brew install` *`formula|cask`* will not upgrade *`formula|cask`* if it is installed but outdated.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALLED_DEPENDENTS_CHECK`
  <br>If set, do not check for broken linkage of dependents or outdated dependents after installing, upgrading or reinstalling formulae. This will result in fewer dependents (and their dependencies) being upgraded or reinstalled but may result in more breakage from running `brew install` *`formula`* or `brew upgrade` *`formula`*.

- `HOMEBREW_NO_UPDATE_REPORT_NEW`
  <br>If set, `brew update` will not show the list of newly added formulae/casks.

- `HOMEBREW_PIP_INDEX_URL`
  <br>If set, `brew install` *`formula`* will use this URL to download PyPI package resources.

  *Default:* `https://pypi.org/simple`.

- `HOMEBREW_PRY`
  <br>If set, use Pry for the `brew irb` command.

- `HOMEBREW_UPGRADE_GREEDY`
  <br>If set, pass `--greedy` to all cask upgrade commands.

- `HOMEBREW_SIMULATE_MACOS_ON_LINUX`
  <br>If set, running Homebrew on Linux will simulate certain macOS code paths. This is useful when auditing macOS formulae while on Linux.

- `HOMEBREW_SKIP_OR_LATER_BOTTLES`
  <br>If set along with `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER`, do not use bottles from older versions of macOS. This is useful in development on new macOS versions.

- `HOMEBREW_SORBET_RUNTIME`
  <br>If set, enable runtime typechecking using Sorbet. Set by default for HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER or when running some developer commands.

- `HOMEBREW_SSH_CONFIG_PATH`
  <br>If set, Homebrew will use the given config file instead of `~/.ssh/config` when fetching Git repositories over SSH.

  *Default:* `$HOME/.ssh/config`

- `HOMEBREW_SVN`
  <br>Use this as the `svn`(1) binary.

  *Default:* A Homebrew-built Subversion (if installed), or the system-provided binary.

- `HOMEBREW_SYSTEM_ENV_TAKES_PRIORITY`
  <br>If set in Homebrew's system-wide environment file (`/etc/homebrew/brew.env`), the system-wide environment file will be loaded last to override any prefix or user settings.

- `HOMEBREW_TEMP`
  <br>Use this path as the temporary directory for building packages. Changing this may be needed if your system temporary directory and Homebrew prefix are on different volumes, as macOS has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist. This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations.

  *Default:* macOS: `/private/tmp`, Linux: `/tmp`.

- `HOMEBREW_UPDATE_TO_TAG`
  <br>If set, always use the latest stable tag (even if developer commands have been run).

- `HOMEBREW_VERBOSE`
  <br>If set, always assume `--verbose` when running commands.

- `HOMEBREW_VERBOSE_USING_DOTS`
  <br>If set, verbose output will print a `.` no more than once a minute. This can be useful to avoid long-running Homebrew commands being killed due to no output.

- `SUDO_ASKPASS`
  <br>If set, pass the `-A` option when calling `sudo`(8).

- `all_proxy`
  <br>Use this SOCKS5 proxy for `curl`(1), `git`(1) and `svn`(1) when downloading through Homebrew.

- `ftp_proxy`
  <br>Use this FTP proxy for `curl`(1), `git`(1) and `svn`(1) when downloading through Homebrew.

- `http_proxy`
  <br>Use this HTTP proxy for `curl`(1), `git`(1) and `svn`(1) when downloading through Homebrew.

- `https_proxy`
  <br>Use this HTTPS proxy for `curl`(1), `git`(1) and `svn`(1) when downloading through Homebrew.

- `no_proxy`
  <br>A comma-separated list of hostnames and domain names excluded from proxying by `curl`(1), `git`(1) and `svn`(1) when downloading through Homebrew.

## USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY

Set the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `all_proxy`, `ftp_proxy` and/or `no_proxy`
environment variables documented above.

For example, to use an unauthenticated HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy:

    export http_proxy=http://$HOST:$PORT

    export all_proxy=socks5://$HOST:$PORT

And for an authenticated HTTP proxy:

    export http_proxy=http://$USER:$PASSWORD@$HOST:$PORT
