The variables \fBHOMEBREW_PREFIX\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_CELLAR\fR and \fBHOMEBREW_REPOSITORY\fR are also exported to avoid querying them multiple times\.

.
.P
You can specify the \fBBrewfile\fR location using \fB\-\-file\fR or by setting the \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_FILE\fR environment variable\.
.
.P
You can skip the installation of dependencies by adding space\-separated values to one or more of the following environment variables: \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_BREW_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_CASK_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_MAS_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_WHALEBREW_SKIP\fR, \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_TAP_SKIP\fR\.

This contains dependency and system status information which can be useful in debugging \fBbrew bundle\fR failures and replicating a "last known good build" state\. You can opt\-out of this behaviour by setting the \fBHOMEBREW_BUNDLE_NO_LOCK\fR environment variable or passing the \fB\-\-no\-lock\fR option\. You may wish to check this file into the same version control system as your \fBBrewfile\fR (or ensure your version control system ignores it if you\'d prefer to rely on debugging information from a local machine)\.

.
.P
\fBbrew bundle exec\fR \fIcommand\fR
    Run an external command in an isolated build environment based on the \fBBrewfile\fR dependencies\.
.
.P
This sanitized build environment ignores unrequested dependencies, which makes sure that things you didn\'t specify in your \fBBrewfile\fR won\'t get picked up by commands like \fBbundle install\fR, \fBnpm install\fR, etc\. It will also add compiler flags which will help find keg\-only dependencies like \fBopenssl\fR, \fBicu4c\fR, etc\.

.SH "CUSTOM EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the \fBPATH\fR, named \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR or \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR\fB\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew\fR \fIcmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew\'s internals\.
.
.P
Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://docs\.brew\.sh/External\-Commands\fR
.
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBhomebrew/core\fR\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary file
Homebrew can install formulae from a local path\. It can point to either a formula file or a bottle\. Prefix relative paths with \fB\./\fR to prevent them from being interpreted as a formula or tap name\.
.
.SH "SPECIFYING CASKS"
Many Homebrew Cask commands accept one or more \fIcask\fR arguments\. These can be specified the same way as the \fIformula\fR arguments described in \fBSPECIFYING FORMULAE\fR above\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Note that environment variables must have a value set to be detected\. For example, run \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT=1\fR rather than just \fBexport HOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fR\.
.
.P
\fBHOMEBREW_*\fR environment variables can also be set in Homebrew\'s environment files:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB/etc/homebrew/brew\.env\fR (system\-wide)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/etc/homebrew/brew\.env\fR (prefix\-specific)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/homebrew/brew\.env\fR if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is set or \fB$HOME/\.homebrew/brew\.env\fR otherwise (user\-specific)
.
.IP "" 0

.P
User\-specific environment files take precedence over prefix\-specific files and prefix\-specific files take precedence over system\-wide files (unless \fBHOMEBREW_SYSTEM_ENV_TAKES_PRIORITY\fR is set, see below)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_API_DOMAIN\fR

\fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN\fR
.
.br
Prefix all download URLs, including those for bottles, with this value\. For example, \fBHOMEBREW_ARTIFACT_DOMAIN=http://localhost:8080\fR will cause a formula with the URL \fBhttps://example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR to instead download from \fBhttp://localhost:8080/https://example\.com/foo\.tar\.gz\fR\. Bottle URLs however, have their domain replaced with this prefix\. This results in e\.g\. \fBhttps://ghcr\.io/v2/homebrew/core/gettext/manifests/0\.21\fR to instead be downloaded from \fBhttp://localhost:8080/v2/homebrew/core/gettext/manifests/0\.21\fR
